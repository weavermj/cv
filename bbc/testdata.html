            <h3>Test Data</h3>
            <p>
                For the majority of testing during on-going development of the plugin, I used a set of 12 news articles that I compiled from the BBC News RSS feed
                in a static JSON file with 2 fields to represent the title and description of each news article. Working with a consistent set of data helped identify
                errors more easily when coding the updating of the navigation links from interaction with both the direct page links and previous/next navigation arrows.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wherever a pagination device is rendered in these pages I have provided a link to the raw JSON test data that is used as the input to it.
            </p>
