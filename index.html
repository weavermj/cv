						Portfolio
						</h5>
						<p>
						As a Network Specialist I have developed several web-based applications using PHP, Perl and Ruby-on-Rails (all OO) hosted in a Linux server environment with a mix of PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.</p>
						<ul class="lancaster">

							<span class="heading">
								<p>Phone Lock</p><span class="url_spacer"></span>
								<img src="images/pinlock-1.png">
							</span>
							<p class="blurb">
							An application to restrict a phone’s dialling privileges. I designed this application to allow users to lock and unlock their phone with a PIN. An XML-based phone interface on Cisco 7940 handsets allows users to control their phone and see its status. The back-end application issues changes in dialling level to the Cisco Call Manager phone system using an XML SOAP interface. A web-based GUI gives admin staff the capability to control all phones and provides management reporting and alerting (e.g. failed login attempts, unusual activity out-of-hours).
							</p>
							</li>
							
						<li class="second">
						<span class="heading">
						<p>Soft Phone Service</p><span class="url_spacer"></span>
						<img src="images/asterisk-1.png">
						</span>
						<p class="blurb">
						A self-service web front end for Asterisk PBX. I developed a web application to manage the provisioning of soft phone accounts. A web portal allows users to authenticate via single sign-on using CoSign and automatically sets up their soft phone account. MySQL stores the dial plan and the Asterisk application is configured to reference the database in real-time, rather than cache static files in memory. An admin GUI provides a dashboard of tools, including dial plan management and call usage filtering.</p></li>

						</span>
						<p class="blurb">
						A device validation portal for students in halls of residence. This was a large project involving many developments over several years. Initially I designed a student portal using the Mason framework to guide users through getting connected. The platform copes with a wide range of browser and operating system combinations, detecting the user-agent and rendering custom CSS and Javascript where necessary. ImageMagick provides screenshots with personalised annotations to improve the user experience. A RESTful HTTP API communicates with the university’s in-house network access control system to grant users rights to the network and interfaces with network switches via SNMP to reconfigure the network in real-time. A quota system was later introduced where I converted bandwidth utilisation data from an xml feed into a meaningful graph using a ChartDirector library. Rate-limiting configuration is applied to core network equipment via an XML API once a user exceeds their given quota. </p></li>

						<span class="heading">
						<p>One Click Database</p><span class="url_spacer"></span>
						<img src="images/ocd-1.png">
						</span>
						<p class="blurb">
						This is my latest project, and my first foray into Ruby-on-Rails. The application provides a web administration GUI for provisioning Cisco IP Phones and maintaining a mapping of users, their devices, extension numbers and unified communications features. It integrates with the Cisco Call Manager phone system using an XML SOAP API to deploy new devices and allow the Service Desk to control and view the display of any phone on campus. Written in Rails 3, I have used my existing experience from working with other MVC frameworks such as Cake PHP to quickly learn Ruby and the Rails framework. The next phase is to provide a self-service portal to allow departments to manage their own phone changes.</p></li>

						<p class="paragraph">
						Throughout my career I have always developed web sites and web applications in my spare time. This is how I initially built up my knowledge of HTML and the W3C standards, where my roots as a developer started using HTML3.2 back in 1997. </p>
						<h5>Portfolio</h5>

						</span>
						<p class="blurb">
						Language Café are a small language school in Salford, Manchester. The brief was to create a website that presented a friendly, welcoming and non-corporate image to students from all nationalities. I used Joomla 2.5 with PHP as the CMS, working closely with the school’s director Helena to convert her vision for the site from sketches on paper into a set of templates in HTML5 and CSS3. The site benefits from a clean look-and-feel with SEO-optimised content and integration with Google Analytics for traffic management. The next phase of this project is to implement a responsive design for mobile devices and tablets using media queries.</p></li>

						I was a member of the Lancaster Amateur Dramatic and Operatic Society for 6 years where I worked as a voluntary sound engineer, creating effects, wiring stages and mixing vocals in live performances. I was approached to design an online presence for the society in 2005 which I wrote in PHP using my own framework and MySQL database for content; since then I have redesigned the site with WordPress and trained the Committee in the use of its CMS features.</p></li>

						<span class="heading">
						<p>Inquire UK</p><span class="url_spacer"></span>
						<img src="images/inquire-1.png">
						</span>
						<p class="blurb">
						I developed a custom document management system for Inquire UK in PHP, to allow authors to submit proposals via a web-portal. The power in this system is in the back-end application, which allows committee members to review submissions, rank them and flag them for further consideration. This project makes heavy use of jQuery to provide AJAX-style editing of information and real-time construction of e-mail replies to submissions in the browser.</p></li>
